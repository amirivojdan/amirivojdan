## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently I'm a first year PhD student in Biosystems Engineering doing research in (Smart Agriculture Lab)[https://www.ut-smartagriculture.com/].
Basically we are trying to apply computer vision, machine learning, and robotic techniques to streamline/automate processes in farming.
